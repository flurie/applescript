*** Purpose
Home of miscellaneous AppleScripts

*** Scripts
**** [[./scripts/SavePlaylist.scpt]]
Saves each of Apple Music's autogenerated playlists to a new playlist with the format "YYYY-MM-DD {Playlist Name}" at 12PM the day after each playlist is refreshed
***** Requirements
- An Apple Music subscription
- Your Apple Music Mix playlists added to your playlists
***** Installation
Run the ~setup.sh~ script
#+begin_src shell
./setup.sh install scripts/SavePlaylist.scpt
#+end_src
This installs the AppleScript and a launchd config for running it automatically
***** Caveats
- AppleScripts not run while machine is sleeping are run on wake. If the machine is shut down when the script is scheduled to run, the script will not run.
